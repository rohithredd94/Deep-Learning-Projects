# Image-Classification-CIFAR10

Contents of each batch file
data -- a 10000x3072 numpy array of uint8s. Each row of the array stores a 32x32 colour image. The first 1024 entries contain the red channel values, the next 1024 the green, and the final 1024 the blue. The image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 32 entries of the array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.
labels -- a list of 10000 numbers in the range 0-9. The number at index i indicates the label of the ith image in the array data.

label_names -- a 10-element list which gives meaningful names to the numeric labels in the labels array described above. For example, label_names[0] == "airplane", label_names[1] == "automobile", etc.

Softmax Classifier - Accuracy - 25-30% - Simple Algorithm but already way better than guessing randomly
